  # Homebrew runs these on every upgrade too, and checks every launchctl service with sudo: only
  # quitting paw here, or each upgrade would ask for a password (and remove the Dock helper,
  # `sudo paw dock install`). paw says when an update changed the helper;
  # `sudo paw dock uninstall` removes it, and so does --zap.
